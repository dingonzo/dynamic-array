Program Purpose:
---------------

    TODO: 
    - Most of my files center around three different 
lists including a test_file list provided by the class.
    - From a list that only has 1 capacity to another that can 
take in more, i created different functions per the specs provided 
that changed the structure of each list in different ways. with the 
creation of these functions and the continual "modular testing" I 
was able to pass an actual timer file with little to now errror.


Compile/run:
-----------

    Compile and Run using the command "unit_test"


Acknowledgments:
---------------

    TODO: I used  c++.com to assist me in my work. I also used 
    piazza to see if there were any other students that had the same 
    trouble as me. This and w3schools served as a huge help for me.
    I spent approximately 10 hours on this homework due to the 
    testing.


Files:
-----

ArrayList.h: Interface for a simple ArrayList Class.

ArrayList.cpp: Implementation of a simple ArrayList Class.
    The default constructor for this class initializes an ArrayList 
    to a size of 0, and a capacity of 10. 

unit_tests.h: A unit testing file for the ArrayList Class. 
    Runs in conjunction with the unit_test framework to allow for 
    testing of individual functions.

timer_main.cpp: A unit testing file for the ArrayList Class.
---Runs a main() function, and when compiled and linked to the 
completed CharArrayList class, an excutable will be created which 
runs a number of CharArrayList operations and prints out the times 
(in nanoseconds) taken to run those operations. All of these 
operations are run on a fresh CharArrayList instance containing 
1,000,000 random characters.

Makefile: File to build the program.


Data Structures:
---------------

This main data structure of this homework is an ArrayList, which is a 
dynamically expanding array. If the number of items is ever equal 
to the capacity, the array will automatically expand, allowing for an 
arbitrary number of elements to be inserted into the ArrayList.


Testing:
-------

    TODO: Testing has been done by every created class, constructor,
and deconstructor. I would add cout text to ensure that each phase 
worked.Most of the testing files have not been commented out incase for 
any review.

Questions:
--------
1. There are three categories of operations listed (insertion, removal,
and access). Within each category, list the times each operation
look and rank the operations from fastest to slowest.    

All operations below are run on a separate, randomly generated
CharArrayList of size 10000.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCESS OPERATION                      //1           Time (nanoseconds)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
call last() 100 times                               290         //1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
call first() 100 times                              321         //2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
call elementAt() for middle of list 100 times       331         //3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERTION OPERATION                 //2             Time (nanoseconds) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pushAtBack 100 times                                547         //1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
insertAt middle of list 100 times                   661967      //2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pushAtFront 100 times                               1621030     //3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
REMOVAL OPERATION                      //3          Time (nanoseconds) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
popFromBack 100 times                               329         //1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
removeAt middle of list 100 times                   1059536     //2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
popFromFront 100 times                              1355344     //3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Discuss these rankings. 
    Why were certain operations so much faster or slower than others? 
    ---- The access operations will always on average be faster than the 
    other operations based on the computer calculating the exact address 
    of any index instantly using simple math.
    ---- The insertion operations will take a relatively slower time due 
    to the funtions shifting through arrays to make different insertions. 
    the pushatBack function will be the fastest in this group due to 
    the relative easier time a computer has in adding a new item to the 
    end of the list.
    ---- The removal operations on average, take a little longer to run 
    through. Due to the remove functions. Which operations took 
    approximately the same amount of time? 
    ---- The call funcitons took about the same amount of time.
    What are the features of array lists that caused these disparities 
    or similarities in times?
    ---- It could be the physical structure of how an array list is 
    stored in computer memory. Array lists typically store their
    elements in one unbroken block of memory. Which in turn makes the 
    access functions fast. However, in turn this also affects other
    functions and their ability to run. pushatFront is a good exmaple 
    of this, becuase of the structure of the array list, the function 
    cannot just put an item into the front. The computer has to shift 
    the entire list to the right to make room.
